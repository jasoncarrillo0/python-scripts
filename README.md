# python-scripts
This repository contains scripts I've used in my personal life. The scripts I uploaded Jan 1, 2020, all were made to
aid my arabic studies in Lebanon. Using Python, Excel, and online resources, I created a list of the top 1500 most 
frequently used words in the Lebanese Arabic dialect, with english translation, phonetic pronunciation, as well as
the type of word. I worked with Anki, a flashcard program optimized for memory retention.

Files include a lot of string manipulation, working with spreadsheets, and a little bit of NLP and some data
visualization.
